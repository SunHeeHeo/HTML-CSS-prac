<h1>Semantic tags</h1>
<div>
  div is literally like a box! but, doesn't have any value everyting was with
  div before
</div>
<h2>
  but, you need to explain the document as good as you can you can use boxes
  that mean something. these are semantic tags.
</h2>
<header>
  the tag of header could be replaced by div it is just like a div but it gives
  meaning to you when you read the codes
</header>
<mian>
  the main tag is somthing like "div id=main" it represents the dominant content
  of the body of a document
</mian>
<span> span tag is for short text </span>
<p>on the other hand, p tag is for paragragh</p>
if you make codes with semantic tages, it would be faster to understand all the
meaning of the tags.
